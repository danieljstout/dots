# Just 2 dotfiles

if you want a prompt in the zshrc, add one. You can append a 

```shell
eval $(starship init zsh)


```

and use the starship.toml if that's something you'd like. It looks like this:

```┌╼ ZSH dots   main 
┌╼ ZSH dots   main 
└──╼ >>> 
```

You'll need to install 

- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- zsh-history-substring-search
- zsh-autosuggestions
